Echo-Life - A Multimodal AI Rescue System


# Overview:
Welcome to Echo-Life, an open-source and non-profit project dedicated to revolutionizing disaster response efforts. Echo-Life harnesses the power of cutting-edge technology to address one of the most critical challenges in disaster scenarios: locating and rescuing survivors trapped under debris caused by earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.

# Key Features:

Multimodal AI Analysis: Echo-Life utilizes Python, PyTorch, RAM, CPU resources, and the Mojo Acceleration framework for advanced audio machine learning. It processes audio data in real time, analyzing sound frequencies, including ultrasonic ranges, to detect survivors' locations.

# 3D Visualization: Spectral audio data is transformed into interactive 3D models, providing a dynamic and intuitive representation of audio intensity over time and frequency. Users can explore and interact with the audio data for enhanced understanding.

# Data Processing: The project includes components for spectral data extraction, data preprocessing, and mapping to 3D space. These technical aspects ensure the accuracy and usability of the system.

# Importance:

Echo-Life's significance lies in its potential to save lives during disaster response. By offering rapid, precise, and resource-efficient methods for locating survivors, Echo-Life empowers rescue teams to make informed decisions and expedite their efforts.
